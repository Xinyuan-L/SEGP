As a Chinese proverb spread for a long time,'Bread is the staff of life.'
In China, people attach great importance to food culture.
In addition, according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the demand for food, namely its Physiological needs, is the most basic need of human beings.
As we know, Chinese students in the UK are always confused about what to eat today and how to cook today. 
Many British people only know a few famous dishes, such as Beijing Roast Duck and Mapo Tofu, but have not experienced about other dishes.
Therefore, it is a serious problem that needs to be solved urgently to help overseas students in the UK to select the recipes and help British people understand Chinese food.
Sinocook helps overseas students and foreigners who are interested in Chinese food culture to solve the problem of choosing today's meals, which can spread and promote Chinese food culture.
