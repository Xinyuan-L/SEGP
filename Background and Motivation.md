## Background literature

The history of traditional Chinese food can be traced back to the Peking Man around 400,000 years ago. 

Some other accounts of the history of Chinese cuisine take the beginning to the Chinese stone age, where the cultivation of rice and the production of noodles began, both of them are typical representations of Chinese cuisine as we know today originated from archaeological findings. 

China covers a large territory and has has a very diverse landscape including deserts, mountains, plateaus and fertile river basins and each region has its own regional climates. 

These differences of geography and climate give rise to the various regional cultural and culinary practices among people in the whole nation , hence a variety of Chinese food with different but fantastic and mouthwatering flavor. 

Since China's local dishes have their own typicalcharacteristics, generally, Chinese people have named eight major cuisines according to their geographical locations , including the Su System (Jiangsu province) , the Wan System (Anhui province), the Min System (Fujian province),  the Xiang System (Hunan province), the Yue System (Cantonese province) , the Chuan System (Sichuan province) , the Lu System (Shandong province) and the Zhe System (Zhejiang province).

There were so many cuisines to choose from that the Chinese student was confused about what to eat or how to cook it today.

## State of the art survey

According to a questionnaire survey covering 30 people, we found that 86.67% of Chinese students in the UK had difficulty in choosing "don't know what to eat today" and 83.33% wanted a website to teach them how to cook authentic Chinese food.

Therefore, we preliminarily formulated the overarching aim of our project is recipe recommendation.

In order to solve this problem, we designed a personalized menu recommendation system to provide users with daily recipes to solve their struggle about three meals.

Considering that different groups have different dietary preferences, we designed some questions to collect users' preferences.

In this way, we can recommend the recipe according to the user's answer, in order to fully meet the user's preferences.

David, a Web product builder, puts forward that the user experience of a product is "the transcendence of user expectations of usability (emotion)" from the functional and emotional levels.[[**2**]](#references)。

Zichermann, based on the three design levels of instinct, behavior and reflection, argues that the emotional value of products can make people happier and more creative in the use of products. 

He also  emphasizes the importance of emotional value in product design.[[**3**]](#references)。

Considering that user-friendly design and service will greatly improve the reviews of the site, we added a game element ———— a slot machine game will be used to recommend recipes.

Nowadays, there are some recipe websites that sharing Chinese recipes exist , such as meishishequ, meishitianxia, meishijie, xiachufang, haodouwang and so on. 

Some community recipe websites have become the mainstream trend of recipe website development, such as the website of sharing recipes and discovering delicious food represented by Haodou and Xiachufang.

However, the user experience of these food community sites still needs to be improved.

The communication and interactivity of these sites is not sufficiently developed, so they fail to motivate users.

According to the monthly active user data ranked by Netease Hao, the number of haodou 's users is over 20 million and the monthly active users are 3.776 million , which ranking the first.

The xiachufang has more than 13 million users and 3.567 million monthly active users, which ranks second.[[**4**]](#references)。

We selected two representative websites Xiachufang and Haodou to analyze .

The analysis results are as follows:

## Problem definition

Through literature review and analysis of existing Chinese recipe websites, we find that these websites need to be strengthened in user experience, user interaction and interest.

For example, these sites lack personalized recommendation services and gamification design, so users' emotional needs are not met.

In order to improve the user experience and interactivity of the website, we use the concept of gamification design throughout the design process of the website.

For example, after the user's needs are counted, the menu is recommended to the user in the form of a slot machine.

We want to bring the fun, motivation, and interactivity of gamification design to the site to improve the user experience.

We want to bring fun and positive incentives to our users in order to increase their dependency on the site.
