Today’s Chinese Food: Have no idea what cook? Use this app!

## Description
Chinese students who are studying in the UK sometime have no idea what to cook. Especially with the lack of traditional ingredient. Our system will recommend you a recipe for cooking with your selection today.  

We will conduct a simple survey on the intention of users to eat by questionnaire. After collecting the survey results, we will randomly select the corresponding ingredients or dishes from the menu and display them in the form of a slot machine/turntable. After the dishes are displayed, the corresponding recipe content will be displayed below. Finally, provide user comment area below, each user (by username) can only post one comment, the length of the comment and name will be limited. 

You input your mood (multiple choice), taste you want to eat today (multiple choice), main ingredient (multiple choice), difficulty level (multiple choice) ... finally, automated generate a turntable and will randomly select you a recipe and tutorial. And just follow the tutorial and cook today’s Chinese food!
