# SinoCook - Chinese Food recommendation Every Day!

Today’s Chinese Food: Have no idea what cook? Use this app!

Chinese students who are studying in the UK sometime have no idea what to cook. Especially with the lack of traditional ingredient. Our system will recommend you a recipe for cooking with your selection today.  

We will conduct a simple survey on the intention of users to eat by questionnaire. After collecting the survey results, we will randomly select the corresponding ingredients or dishes from the menu and display them in the form of a slot machine/turntable. After the dishes are displayed, the corresponding recipe content will be displayed below. Finally, provide user comment area below, each user (by username) can only post one comment, the length of the comment and name will be limited.

You input your mood (multiple choice), taste you want to eat today (multiple choice), main ingredient (multiple choice), difficulty level (multiple choice) ... finally, automated generate a turntable and will randomly select you a recipe and tutorial. And just follow the tutorial and cook today’s Chinese food!  

We mainly focus on the desktop and may adapt the mobile.

## Introduction

### Abstract

As a Chinese proverb spread for a long time,'Bread is the staff of life.'

In China, people attach great importance to food culture.

In addition, according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the demand for food, namely its Physiological needs, is the most basic need of human beings.

As we know, Chinese students in the UK are always confused about what to eat today and how to cook today.

Many British people only know a few famous dishes, such as Beijing Roast Duck and Mapo Tofu, but have not experienced about other dishes.

Therefore, it is a serious problem that needs to be solved urgently to help overseas students in the UK to select the recipes and help British people understand Chinese food.

Sinocook helps overseas students and foreigners who are interested in Chinese food culture to solve the problem of choosing today's meals, which can spread and promote Chinese food culture.

Each time you log in, the site will recommend a random recipe.

You can also select a diet preference and receive personalized recommendations, then you will get randomly recipe recommended by a slot machine game.

The site also includes a comment section where users can post their comments anonymously.
